# Handling Git Rebase Conflicts: "Deleted by Us" vs "Deleted by Them"

When working with Git, rebasing is a common task to keep a feature branch up to date with the main branch. Sometimes during a rebase, you might encounter conflicts marked as "deleted by us" or "deleted by them." Understanding these concepts is crucial to resolving conflicts effectively and maintaining a clean Git history.

## Understanding the Rebase

A rebase essentially moves the commits from your feature branch so that they start from the latest commit of the base branch (`origin/master` in this case). The command used is:

```bash
git rebase origin/master
```

Assuming you are on your local branch `beam-flink-remove-beam-dependency`, this command tries to apply each commit from your branch on top of the latest from `origin/master`.

## Conflict Types: "Deleted by Us" and "Deleted by Them"

During a rebase, Git tries to apply each commit from your feature branch onto the base branch. Conflicts can arise, particularly with file deletions:

- **Deleted by us**: This conflict occurs when a file or changes have been deleted in your current branch (`beam-flink-remove-beam-dependency`) but exist in the `origin/master` branch. Here, "us" refers to your current branch.

- **Deleted by them**: This happens when a file or changes have been deleted in the `origin/master` branch but exist in your branch. In this scenario, "them" refers to the branch you're rebasing onto (`origin/master`).

## Example Scenario

Imagine you have the following scenario where a file named `example.txt` exists:

### Initial Setup

- In `origin/master`, the file `example.txt` is present.
- You create a new branch `beam-flink-remove-beam-dependency` from `origin/master` and delete `example.txt`.

Now, if during this time, changes are made to `example.txt` in `origin/master` and you run a rebase, you will face a "deleted by us" conflict because you deleted the file in your branch but it was modified in `origin/master`.

### Resolving Conflicts

To resolve these conflicts, you can take the following steps based on what you decide:

1. **Keep the file**: You might decide to keep the file with the changes from `origin/master`.

   ```bash
   git checkout --theirs path/to/example.txt
   ```

2. **Delete the file**: If retaining your deletion is what you need:

   ```bash
   git rm path/to/example.txt
   ```

3. **Modify and keep part of changes**: Open the file, manually make the necessary edits, and then mark the file as resolved:
   ```bash
   git add path/to/example.txt
   ```

Once conflicts are resolved, you can continue the rebase process:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the meaning of "deleted by us" and "deleted by them" during a Git rebase helps you make informed decisions about resolving conflicts. Each conflict resolution should be aligned with the goal of your development and the current state of the codebase to maintain coherency and functionality.
